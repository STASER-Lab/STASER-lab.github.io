We focus on understanding how social and technical factors interact in software engineering processes. Our research addresses fundamental questions about how developers work, collaborate, and make decisions in software development environments. Our lab collaborates with industry partners and open source communities to translate research insights into practical improvements for software development practices. Previous Next Research Projects Our lab conducts research across multiple domains of software engineering.\nActive Research Projects\nMining Software Repositories for EDI Insights — Analyzing GitHub repositories to understand patterns of equity, diversity, and inclusion. Bug Prediction Using Machine Learning — Predicting defects from code patterns and development history. Social Network Analysis in Software Teams — Studying collaboration and communication networks to improve productivity.
